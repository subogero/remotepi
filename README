RemotePi -- Raspberry Pi media centre with remote control
=========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

RemotePi is a remote control web app to browse your RaspberryPi's music/videos,
internet radio stations or YouTube and play them via the omxd playlist daemon.

RemotePi is optimized for small smartphone screens.

RemotePi is strictly file and directory based and could not care less
for MP3 tags in files. MP3 tags are evil and rude.

Features:
 - browse the Raspberry file system below a specified root dir
 - browse internet radio stations using rpi.fm
 - browse and play YouTube videos
 - insert and append files, stremas or entire directories to the omxd playlist
 - play files now on Jack or HDMI audio and then return to playlist
 - play/pause, repeat, previous/next in playlist, RW/FF.

RemotePi is a FastCGI (mod_fcgid) app.

## INSTALL

sudo make install

This installs RemotePi's dependencies too: apache2, omxd, rpi.fm, youtube-dl
and the necessary Perl libraries.

## USE

Point your PC/tablet/phone's browser to http://raspberry/remotepi on your
home WiFi network. Enjoy.

The buttons wear the name of the respctive omxd commands, see the tooltips,
the "help" tab or omxd's README or man page.

## REST API

RemotePi offers a JSON-based REST API to control all functions:

 GET url/S* - playlist and playback status
 POST url/S {"cmd":"x"} - playlist commands

 GET url/home/dir... - list dir on Raspberry Pi
 POST url/home {"cmd":"x","file":"file"} - append file/dir to playlist

 GET url/fm/cmd1/... - rpi.fm command list for listings
 POST url/fm ["cmd1",...] - rpi.fm command list ending with playlist command

 GET url/yt/search/term - YouTube search for term
 POST url/yt {"cmd":"·∫ç","query":"id"} - YouTube playback command
