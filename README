RemotePi -- remote control web app for Raspberry Pi omxd media player
=====================================================================

## DESCRIPTION

RemotePi is a remote control web app to browse music/videos
on your Raspberry Pi and play them via the omxd playlist daemon.

RemotePi is optimized for small smartphone screens.

RemotePi is strictly file and directory based and could not care less
for MP3 tags in files. MP3 tags are evil and rude.

Features: 
 - browse the Raspberry file system below a specified root dir
 - insert and append files or entire directories to the omxd playlist
 - play files now on Jack or HDMI audio and then return to playlist
 - play/pause, repeat, previous/next in playlist, RW/FF.

## FILES

### /etc/remotepi.cfg

Contains the root directory below which browsing is allowed for RemotePi.
If the file does not exist, the default root directory is /home.
