RemotePi -- Raspberry Pi media centre with remote control
=========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

RemotePi is a remote control web app to browse your RaspberryPi's music/videos
or internet radio stations and play them via the omxd playlist daemon.

RemotePi is optimized for small smartphone screens.

RemotePi is strictly file and directory based and could not care less
for MP3 tags in files. MP3 tags are evil and rude.

Features: 
 - browse the Raspberry file system below a specified root dir
 - browse internet radio stations using rpi.fm
 - insert and append files, stremas or entire directories to the omxd playlist
 - play files now on Jack or HDMI audio and then return to playlist
 - play/pause, repeat, previous/next in playlist, RW/FF.
